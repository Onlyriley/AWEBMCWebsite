            <h1>Back-end Development</h1>
            <h3>AWEB is NOT an open source project</h3>
            <p>Due to the nature of minecraft servers, it is not realistic to publish the server contents as an open source project due to security and development environments.</p>
            <p>The only way to manage the back end of the server is through remote SSH to the cloud, in which access is very restricted.</p>
            <p>If you are interested in back-end development or reporting a bug, send me a message through the "Contact" page.</p>

            <p>Currently there are two administrators (@yodaeyem, @jesscantski). This position is not open, so please do not ask for it.</p>
            <p>Positions are available for builders and moderators. In order to become a builder/moderator, you must be active on the server for atleast a month.</p>
